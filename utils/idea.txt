Basic Project Ideas:

1. Find the best open-source research LLM (Large Language Model) with fewer parameters for initial prototyping (e.g., Phi-3, TinyLlama, Mistral, or Llama 3 8B).
2. Fine-tune the selected LLM on financial datasets (e.g., SEC filings, earnings reports, news, analyst reports, historical stock data).
3. Create an AI agent that performs investment research (summarizes financials, analyzes sentiment, generates investment theses, answers finance questions).
4. Build an MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) server with a stock trading module (integrate with broker APIs like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or Zerodha).
5. Automate stock trading based on agent recommendations (paper trading first, then real trading with risk controls).

Additional Suggestions:

6. Implement a data pipeline for real-time and historical financial data ingestion (using APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl).
7. Add explainability features to the agent (show reasoning, highlight key data points, provide risk analysis).
8. Develop a web dashboard for monitoring agent decisions, portfolio performance, and trade logs.
9. Integrate backtesting functionality to evaluate strategies before live trading.
10. Ensure robust logging, error handling, and compliance with trading regulations.
11. Add user authentication and role-based access for secure usage.
12. Consider reinforcement learning for adaptive trading strategies.
13. Regularly update and retrain the model with new financial data to maintain accuracy.
14. Explore ensemble methods (combine LLM with traditional ML models for better predictions).
15. Document the project thoroughly for reproducibility and future improvements.

Step-wise Procedure:

1. **Research and Selection**
   - Survey available open-source LLMs with fewer parameters (e.g., Phi-3, TinyLlama, Mistral, Llama 3 8B).
   - Benchmark their performance on basic financial tasks.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Gather financial datasets (SEC filings, earnings reports, news, analyst reports, historical stock data).
   - Clean and preprocess the data for model training.

3. **Model Fine-tuning**
   - Fine-tune the selected LLM on the curated financial datasets.
   - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on validation tasks.

4. **AI Agent Development**
   - Build an AI agent that can:
     - Summarize financials
     - Analyze sentiment
     - Generate investment theses
     - Answer finance-related questions

5. **MCP Server and Trading Module**
   - Develop a Multi-Channel Platform (MCP) server.
   - Integrate a stock trading module using broker APIs (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, Zerodha).

6. **Automation and Paper Trading**
   - Automate trading based on agent recommendations.
   - Start with paper trading to test strategies safely.

7. **Backtesting and Risk Controls**
   - Implement backtesting to evaluate strategies on historical data.
   - Add risk management and compliance checks.

8. **Dashboard and Monitoring**
   - Create a web dashboard for:
     - Monitoring agent decisions
     - Portfolio performance
     - Trade logs

9. **Explainability and Reporting**
   - Add features to explain agent decisions (reasoning, key data points, risk analysis).
   - Generate regular reports for users.

10. **Security and Access Control**
    - Implement user authentication and role-based access.

11. **Continuous Improvement**
    - Regularly retrain the model with new data.
    - Explore reinforcement learning and ensemble methods.
    - Maintain thorough documentation for reproducibility.

12. **Deployment and Scaling**
    - Deploy the system for real trading with robust error handling.
    - Ensure compliance with trading regulations.
