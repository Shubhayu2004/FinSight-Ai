- Include company context when relevant
- Use the sample questions as starting points

### **Performance**

- Results are cached for faster subsequent queries

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Backend Not Running**
   - Ensure the backend API is running on port 8000
   - Check the console for connection errors

2. **File Upload Fails**
   - Verify the file is a valid PDF
   - Check file size (should be reasonable)
   - Ensure backend upload directory is writable

3. **Processing Fails**
   - Check if the PDF contains extractable text
   - Verify the backend has necessary dependencies
   - Check backend logs for detailed errors

4. **FinAgent Not Responding**
   - Test the model using "Test FinAgent" button
   - Check model information for status
   - Verify the model path is correct

5. **CORS Errors**
   - The proxy configuration should handle this
   - Ensure backend allows requests from frontend origin

### **Debug Mode**
Enable browser developer tools to see:
- Network requests and responses
- Console errors and warnings
- API call details
